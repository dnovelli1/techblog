## Description

In this assignment I was prompted with the task of creating a full stack application from scratch. The application needed to dynamically generate all html pages from the server side using handlebars. User's needed to be able to sign in or create an account if they have not already. Lastly, the user needed to be able to interact with the application meaning they could do the following:

1) Create posts.
2) Comment on posts.
3) Manage posts they have created (Edit or Delete).
 
Overall the application runs smoothly. Next step will be applying my styling skills to make the application pop!

Please have a look at the full application deployed at the link below:
